# Dr. Klepto

_See it. Swing it. Steal it._

## Game Ideas
* The game's main character, Dr. Klepto, is a Dr. Octopus sort of character with a backpack of many arms that he uses to swing through the game's environment.
* The goal will be the grab as many "treasure" objects in the environment as possible
* These objects could be legitimate treasure, or just random objects being snatched from people.
* The setting would be in a temple (so that it makes sense to have walls on all sides) and could be full of traps, secretes, and might even rotate or have buttons that could be pressed with the claws.
* 2D, sidescrolleresque
